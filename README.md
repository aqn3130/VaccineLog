# VaccineLog
VaccineLOG will provide a digital tool for monitoring immunization in Afghanistan. After review of several similar applications as listed in our application form, we have determined to customize it for suitability in Afghanistan and fill the gaps that exist in available immunization monitoring tools. Adding health care provider user is a big step in customization and modification to other similar applications for the reasons that most families in rural and remote areas will not use the application but the health care provider will use at their local health clinics.
